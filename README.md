# RSA_cryptography	
Program uses the Miller-Rabin Algorithm.
Program finds out whether a given number is prime or not. It takes two prime numbers 
	to generate the public and private keys for RSA algorithm and prints public key. Then program
	asks for the text to be sent to the receiver. This plaintext is converted to the ascii code for
	the purpose of encryption. ASCII code is encrypted using the public key of RSA algorithm. This
	encrypted message is also displayed in program. Than program decrypts the message using private 
	key of RSA algorithm. Finally program convert that decrypted message to plain text and displays.
